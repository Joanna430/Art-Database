# Art-Database
For the databases, it only has a few pieces of information about each artwork â€” artist name (string), artwork name (string), year created (integer), description (string), and owner (string). Based upon client research, it is believed that the most common usage will be for people to search for one or more artworks by the same artist using the artist name and artworks' names. So I decided to optimize my data organization for this common usage by using two levels of dictionaries, keyed by the artist name and artwork name, respectively. The data structure is a dictionary that maps each artist name to a dictionary that maps each artwork name to a tuple of year, description, and owner.
